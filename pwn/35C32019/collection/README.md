# Collection (sandbox, cpython, type confusion)
This challenge was marked as easy and so I thought it might be a good task for first python sandbox escape task. I was wrong and in the end I had to glance few times in on to some other writeups which I found on web.
But besides that I have to say that this challenge has opened my eyes as I would never thought that high level languages such as python can be treated as reallistic target. I would like to recommend [this](https://hackernoon.com/python-sandbox-escape-via-a-memory-corruption-bug-19dde4d5fea5) writeup from bug bounty program which I found online when searching for some cpython exploitation examples.
