Here is another linux user namespaces challenge by popular demand.

For security reasons, this sandbox needs to run as root. If you can break out of the sandbox, there's a flag in /, but even then you might not be able to read it :).

The files are here: https://35c3ctf.ccc.ac/uploads/namespaces-a4b1ac039830f7c430660bc155dd2099.tar 
Service running at: nc 35.246.140.24 1

Hints:
You'll need to create your own user namespace for the intended solution.
