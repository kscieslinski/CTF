# Syscall 200pts
I made a new system call for Linux kernel.
It converts lowercase letters to upper case letters.
would you like to see the implementation?

[Download](files/syscall.c)

ssh syscall@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:guest)


## Note
Unfortunetely as you can see the challenge requires to ssh to pwnable.kr server and so if it is down you wont be able to try it yourself :/
